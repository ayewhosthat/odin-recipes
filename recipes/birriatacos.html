    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Birria Tacos are the embodiment of indulgent food that is rich in flavour, yet also fresh at the same time. Tender beef cooked low and slow in a consomme that is filled with spices, herbs, citrus and history, topped with fresh salsa to cut through the
        richness, the perfect balance between a consomme-dipped tortilla.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs boneless chuck roast</li>
        <li>1 lb oxtail or bone-in short ribs</li>
        <li>1 tsp neutral oil</li>
        <li>7 ancho chiles</li>
        <li>7 guajillo chiles</li>
        <li>3 chiles de arbol</li>
        <li>1 1/4 white onion</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>4 roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp black peppercorns (whole)</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground clove</li>
        <li>1/2 cinammon stick</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tsp apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>3 cups/750mL beef broth or water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced coriander</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>corn tortillas</li>
        <li>3 oz mozzerella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the meat to room temperature, about 30 minutes and then sprinkle liberally on all sides with kosher salt. In a large Dutch oven (or a pot with an oven-proof lid), set over medium-high heat, add the neutral oil. When hot, add the meat and sear on all sides until browned. I like to do a hard sear. Youâ€™ll have to do this in batches. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in another medium pot, add the dried chiles, halved white onion, garlic cloves, tomatoes, spices, bay leaves and add cold water until it covers everything. Place over medium heat and simmer gently for about 15 minutes. Pour through a strainer and transfer the solids (including the whole spices) to a blender. If your blender is small you may need to do this in batches.</li>
        <li>Add the apple cider vinegar and about 1 cup of beef broth or water and blend until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Add salt to taste (I added about 1 tablespoon of kosher salt).</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300F. Add the meat back to the pot and pour the sauce over it. To the blender, add the remaining 2 cups of broth or water and swish it around to pick up any leftover sauce and pour it into the pot. Place over medium heat until it reaches a gentle simmer and then immediately cover and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook for about 3 hours, until the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Mix together the cilantro, white onion, lime and salt.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the sauce and shred using two forks. Ladle the broth into a bowl and add a handful of diced cilantro.</li>
        <li>Add a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Dip the tortilla into the top of the broth (this should be fat) and add it to the skillet. Pan fry on one side for about 30 seconds and then flip over. Add a some of the shredded meat and the shredded cheese. Fold over and cook until pan fried on both sides, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate and serve alongside the broth.</li>
    </ol>
