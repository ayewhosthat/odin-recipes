A small project to get me started on the fundamentals of web development (more specifically, the fundamentals of HTML). By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my knowledge
of various concepts, such as:
* inserting links to other webpages, as well as inserting images
* cloning my repository to my local machine via the command line
* committing changes frequently whenever I made a significant/important change
* understanding what makes a good commit message (subject + description)
* pushing my final finished product to GitHub
